# Guides

A dual-axis index into this repository's guides — by concept, and by directory (AGENTS §22).

## By concept

| Concept | Spec                           | Source                    | Tests                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Rater   | [`src/rater.md`](src/rater.md) | [`src/core`](../src/core) | [`tests/src/core`](../tests/src/core) |

## By directory

| Directory  | Guide                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `src/core` | [`src/rater.md`](src/rater.md) |

## Dependency reference

[`src/reason.md`](src/reason.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/reason` — a runtime dependency. It documents **that package's**
surface (the typed reasoning engine: definitions, subjects, reasoners, and the
builder family), not anything sourced in this repo; it is kept here so a reader
of this package can see the engine every evaluation is delegated to without
leaving this guide set.

[`src/contract.md`](src/contract.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/contract` — a runtime dependency. It documents **that package's**
surface (guards, combinators, parsers, and the shape DSL), not anything sourced
in this repo; it is kept here for the same reason.

[`src/emitter.md`](src/emitter.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/emitter` — a runtime dependency. It documents **that package's**
surface (the typed push-observation `Emitter`), not anything sourced in this
repo; it is kept here for the same reason.

[`src/guide.md`](src/guide.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/guide` — the devDependency powering this repo's guides-parity test
suite (`tests/guides.test.ts`). It documents **that package's**
surface (`Guide` / `Source`, the manifest and comparison helpers), not anything
sourced in this repo; it is kept here so a reader of the parity suite can see
the primitives it is built from without leaving this guide set.
